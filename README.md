# Algorithm report
I used three sorting algorithms, such as Bubble sort, Quick sort, and Insertion sort. Here, in terms of big O notations:
1)	Bubble Sort O(n2)
2)	Insertion Sort O(n2)
3)	Quick Sort O(n * log(n)).

It means that Quick sort is the fastest sorting algorithm. On the other hand, bubble sort and insertion sort are slower, but bubble sort is the slowest. The reason is that the bubble sort that I implemented does more computational operations than insertion sort.
